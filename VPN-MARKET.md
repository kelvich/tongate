### SOCKS based software

+ Tunneling will not disappear on reconnect -- that's quite a big security risk with TUN-based stuff.
+ Can be done on per-app basis (even on per-website basis) or for a whole system
+ No need to edit nameserver and roung tables
+ 
+ shadowsocks as a brand seem to be popular in some communities. Association with shadowsocks may bring some new users.

- some apps may not support socks (however most browsers/torrents/etc do support it)

## Naming
    * tongate
